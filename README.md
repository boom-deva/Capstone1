## Problem Statement

Right to Work laws in the United States have gained attention in the past few years, due to the controversial nature of their claimed benefits and effects. A Right To Work law means that no person can be compelled to join or not to join a labor union as a condition of employment. This is claimed to prevent workers from being denied work at certain companies if they are not union-affiliated. However, it also lessens the power of unions in these states, with many employers being allowed the ability to fire at will.

Despite less than savory beginnings, unions in the United States offer workers safety and protection from employers who are concerned with profit over safety. This is especially noticeable in industries with higher than usual risks. The benefit of unions on workers' overall wages and benefits is well documented. However, safety is a nother major concern that is coming to the forefront of the discussion due to the rising number of injuries and fatalities, according the US Department of Labor statistics.

My project seeks to examine severe injuries and fatalities in the United States in 2017. By analyzing a few states based on their increase or decrease in reported workplace incidents, I will examine correlations between these incidents and their respective state's affiliation with Right to Work.
