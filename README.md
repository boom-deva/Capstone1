## Problem Statement

Right-to-Work laws in the United States have gained attention in the past few years, due to the controversial nature of their claimed benefits and effects. A Right To Work law means that no person can be compelled to join or not to join a labor union as a condition of employment. This is claimed to prevent workers from being denied work at certain companies if they are not union-affiliated. However, it also lessens the power of unions in these states, with many employers being allowed the ability to fire at will.

Despite less than savory beginnings, unions in the United States offer workers safety and protection from employers who are concerned with profit over safety. This is especially noticeable in industries with higher than usual risks. The benefit of unions on workers' overall safety  and benefits is well documented.    
In many states, fatalities have risen as a result of weakened labor laws. Less powerful workers' groups also correspond to lower wages in states where workers lack the power of collective bargaining.

This project will explore the relationship between union membership, RTW laws, worker safety (defined as fatality count) and the poverty rate of states. Using historical data (2010-2017) on union membership throughout the US - as well as in individual states, demographic make up of these states, fatality counts by state and throughout the country, and demographics associated with the individuals, we will predict whether a state will fall above or below the poverty line in the most recent year, to establish the clear correlation between these factors
